CANFestival GUI
---------------

This is a GUI for CANFestival located here:
http://freshmeat.net/redir/canfestival/15271/url_homepage
It uses (almost) all functions of CanOpenMatic (a canopen protocol stack)
and is very useful helping understand the canopen protocol.

who is able to use it:
----------------------
- all person who are able to use CANFestival
- all other person: there's a simulation only mode, where no "real" can
  message are sent, but the can-messages are shown in a log area. so
  you can learn how the canopen protocol works!

known BUGS:
-----------
- The program isn't tested very well, so i suppose you'll find some bugs...
- The program may crash, if too much messages are received in a too short time
  if this happens: search the sourcecode for the string BUG and comment the lines
  there... these lines are for comfort reasons only: with this line the log window
  for received can-messages do scroll automatially, so you can always see the
  last received message. without this code-lines, you'll have to scroll down
  the windows by your mouse :-(
